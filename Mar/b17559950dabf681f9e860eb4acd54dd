Welcome to The Sound Kitchen weekly podcast, published every Saturday – here on our website, or wherever you get your podcasts.

The ePOP video competition is open! The deadline for entries is 20 April  – but don’t put it off! Start now! The ePOP video competition is sponsored by the RFI department “Planète Radio”, whose mission is to give a voice to the voiceless. ePOP focuses on the environment, and how climate change has affected “ordinary” people … you create a three-minute video about climate change, the environment, pollution – told by the people it affects. So put on your thinking caps and get to work ... and by the way, the prizes are incredibly generous! To read the ePOP entry guidelines – as well as watch videos from previous years – go to the ePOP website. Erwan and I are busy cooking up special shows with your musical requests, so get them in! Send your musical requests to thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr  Tell us why you like the piece of music, too – it makes it more interesting for us all! Be sure you check out our wonderful podcasts! In addition to the breaking news articles on our site, with in-depth analysis of current affairs in France and across the globe, we have several podcasts which will leave you hungry for more. There’s Paris Perspective, Spotlight on France, and of course, The Sound Kitchen. We have an award-winning bilingual series – an old-time radio show, with actors (!) to help you learn French, called Les voisins du 12 bis. And there is the excellent International Report, too. As you see, sound is still quite present in the RFI English service.  Keep checking our website for updates on the latest from our staff of journalists. You never know what we’ll surprise you with! To listen to our podcasts from your PC, go to our website; you’ll see “Podcasts” at the top of the page. You can either listen directly or subscribe and receive them directly on your mobile phone. To listen to our podcasts from your mobile phone, slide through the tabs just under the lead article (the first tab is “Headline News”) until you see “Podcasts”, and choose your show. Teachers, take note! I save postcards and stamps from all over the world to send to you for your students. If you would like stamps and postcards for your students, just write and let me know. The address is english.service@rfi.fr  If you would like to donate stamps and postcards, feel free! Our address is listed below. Another idea for your students: Br. Gerald Muller, my beloved music teacher from St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, has been writing books for young adults in his retirement – and they are free! There is a volume of biographies of painters and musicians called Gentle Giants, and an excellent biography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., too. They are also a good way to help you improve your English - that’s how I worked on my French, reading books which were meant for young readers – and I guarantee you, it’s a good method for improving your language skills. To get Br. Gerald’s free books, click here.

This week’s quiz: On 4 February, I asked you a question about a segment on Alison Hird and Sarah Elzas’ podcast Spotlight on France. Alison had a piece on the podcast that week about how the proposed pension reform here will affect women, as often women take time off from work to care for their young children. They will therefore have to work longer than men, to fulfill the amount of time worked to qualify for a full pension. You were to listen closely to the podcast and answer this question: what is one option proposed by the opposition, that the government has refused outright? The answer is, to quote Alison: “One option would be getting retirees to contribute more by effectively lowering their pensions. The government has overruled this outright.” In addition to the quiz question, there was the bonus question: “Who is your role model?” Do you have a bonus question idea? Send it to us! The winners are: RFI English listener Dewan Rafiqul Islam from Naogaon, Bangladesh. Dewan is also the winner of this week’s bonus question. Congratulations Dewan ! Also on the list of lucky winners this week are RFI Listeners Club member Father Steven Wara from Bamenda, Cameroon; Razib, who’s a member of the RFI Fan Club in Naogaon, Bangladesh, and RFI English listeners Dia Zanib from Punjab, Pakistan and Kanwar Sandhu from British Columbia in Canada. Congratulations winners! Here’s the music you heard on this week’s programme: The traditional “Raga Khammaj” performed by Rajeev Janardan; “Salon Buenos Aires” by Miguel del Aguila, performed by APERIO; “The Flight of the Bumblebee” by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov; “The Cakewalk” from Children’s Corner by Claude Debussy, performed by the composer; “Happy” by Pharrell Williams, and “The Joker” by Bojan Zulfikarpasic, performed by Ifrikya. Do you have a musical request? Send it to thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr This week’s question ... you must listen to the show to participate. After you’ve listened to the show, re-read Amanda Morrow’s article “France headed for water curbs as dry winter intensifies drought” to help you with the answer. You have until 27 March to enter this week's quiz; the winners will be announced on the 1 April podcast.
