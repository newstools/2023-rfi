French President Emmanuel Macron will on Friday have dinner with Spain's exiled former king Juan Carlos I and Peruvian Nobel winner Mario Vargas Llosa. The literature laureate joined the √©lite French Academy on 9 February. The 86-year-old novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who also has Spanish citizenship, controversially invited the former monarch to his inauguration ceremony into the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise on Thursday in Paris. Vargas Llosa, considered to be one of the most influential Latin American writers, is the first author to become a member of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise despite never to have written a book in French. üìï Acad√©mie fran√ßaiseüåøM.

But he has lived in exile since 2020 in the United Arab Emirates after a series of scandals, including claims that he harassed a former mistress, as well as revelations about his lavish lifestyle and an elephant hunt in Botswana. Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014 in favour of his son, has made several public appearances recently, including for the funerals of Britain's Elizabeth II and Greece's Constantine II.

"Macron, who invited both of them to supper tomorrow along with Spanish writer Javier Cercas, also recognises this," he wrote.¬†Cercas recently interviewed Macron for Spanish newspaper El Pais. Gracias por lo que usted ha hecho por Espa√±a. Nadie con un m√≠nimo conocimiento del papel que ha jugado para que Espa√±a sea una democracia liberal europea puede dejar de reconoc√©rselo. Macron, que los ha invitado a ambos a cenar ma√±ana junto con Javier Cercas, lo reconoce tambi√©n. pic.twitter.com/HqtGrBzeFD It was not immediately clear where the dinner was to take place.
