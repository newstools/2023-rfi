This week on The Sound Kitchen we celebrate World Radio Day with listener greetings! You’ll hear the answer to the question about France’s hunting laws, the bonus question and the “Listeners Corner” with Michael Fitzpatrick, and “Music from Erwan”. All that, and the new quiz question, too, so click on the “Audio” arrow above and enjoy! Hello everyone! Welcome to The Sound Kitchen weekly podcast, published every Saturday – here on our website, or wherever you get your podcasts. You’ll hear the winner's names announced and the week’s quiz question, along with all the other ingredients you’ve grown accustomed to: your letters and essays, “On This Day”, quirky facts and news, interviews, and great music … so be sure and listen every week. The ePOP video competition is open! The deadline for entries is 20 April 2023 – but don’t put it off! Start now! The ePOP video competition is sponsored by the RFI department “Planète Radio”, whose mission is to give a voice to the voiceless. ePOP focuses on the environment, and how climate change has affected “ordinary” people …you create a three-minute video about climate change, the environment, pollution – told by the people it affects. So put on your thinking caps and get to work ... and by the way, the prizes are incredibly generous! To read the ePOP entry guidelines – as well as watch videos from previous years – go to the ePOP website. Erwan and I are busy cooking up special shows with your musical requests, so get them in! Send your musical requests to thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr  Tell us why you like the piece of music, too – it makes it more interesting for us all! Be sure you check out our wonderful podcasts! In addition to the breaking news articles on our site, with in-depth analysis of current affairs in France and across the globe, we have several podcasts which will leave you hungry for more. There’s Paris Perspective, Spotlight on France, and of course, The Sound Kitchen. We have an award-winning bilingual series – an old-time radio show, with actors (!) to help you learn French, called Les voisins du 12 bis. And there is the excellent International Report, too. As you see, sound is still quite present in the RFI English service.  Keep checking our website for updates on the latest from our staff of journalists. You never know what we’ll surprise you with! To listen to our podcasts from your PC, go to our website; you’ll see “Podcasts” on the upper left-hand side of the page. You can either listen directly or subscribe and receive them directly on your mobile phone. To listen to our podcasts from your mobile phone, slide through the tabs just under the lead article (the first tab is “Headline News”) until you see “Podcasts”, and choose your show. Teachers, take note!  I save postcards and stamps from all over the world to send to you for your students. If you would like stamps and postcards for your students, just write and let me know. The address is english.service@rfi.fr  If you would like to donate stamps and postcards, feel free! Our address is listed below. Another idea for your students: Br. Gerald Muller, my beloved music teacher from St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, has been writing books for young adults in his retirement – and they are free! There is a volume of biographies of painters and musicians called Gentle Giants, and an excellent biography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., too. They are also a good way to help you improve your English - that’s how I worked on my French, reading books which were meant for young readers – and I guarantee you, it’s a good method for improving your language skills. To get Br. Gerald’s free books, click here. Independent RFI English Clubs: Be sure to always include Audrey Iattoni (audrey.iattoni@rfi.fr) from our Listener Relations department in all your RFI Club correspondence. Remember to copy me (thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr) when you write to her so that I know what is going on, too. N.B.: You do not need to send her your quiz answers! Email overload!

This week’s quiz: On 14 January, I asked you a question about an article written by Michael Fitzpatrick: “France tightens hunting regulations but stops short of weekend ban”.  Activist groups want to see a ban on hunting on Sundays, to protect walkers and people who live near active hunting areas – and hunters are against it. I asked you to answer these two questions: how many active hunters are there in France, and how many French people possess a hunting licence? The answer is, to quote Michael’s article: “There are 1.1 million active hunters in France, according to the FNC, and some five million people possess a hunting licence.” In addition to the quiz question, there was the bonus question: “What is your favorite proverb?” Do you have a bonus question idea? Send it to us! The winners are: RFI English listener Murshida Yeasmin Momota from Bogura, Bangladesh. Murshida is also the winner of this week’s bonus question. Congratulations Murshida! Also on the list of lucky winners this week are Debakamal Hazarika, the president of the United RFI Listeners Club in Assam, India; Asifa Riaz, a member of the RFI Listeners Club in Sheikhupura City, Pakistan; RFI Listeners Club member Babby Noor Al Haya Hussen from Odisha, India, and RFI English listener Sultana Begum from Sirajganj, Bangladesh. Congratulations winners! Here’s the music you heard on this week’s programme: The rondo from the Horn Concerto No. 4 in E flat major by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, performed by the Dresden Philharmonic conducted by Jorg-Peter Weigle with soloist Sebastian Weigle; “The Flight of the Bumblebee” by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov; “The Cakewalk” from Children’s Corner by Claude Debussy, performed by the composer, and “Young Mama” by Olu Dara, performed by Dara and his ensemble. Do you have a musical request? Send it to thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr This week’s question ... you must listen to the show to participate. After you’ve listened to the show, re-read Michael Fitzpatrick’s article “Paris summit in effort to lift Lebanon out of political paralysis” to help you with the answer.
