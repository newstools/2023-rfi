Amnesty International reports that fighters from the DemocraticÂ Republic of Congo's M23 rebel group killed at least 20 men andÂ raped dozens of women and girls in the country's east in November. The M23 have dismissed the claims. Following the publication of the Amnesty report this Friday, the M23Â militiaÂ â€“ which stepped up its offensive in regions nearÂ the borders with Rwanda and Uganda last year â€“ dismissed theÂ accusations, saying they were part of a smear campaign. The NGO's reported death toll was much lower than estimates fromÂ the United Nations, which said in December that the rebels had executedÂ at least 131 people in reprisal killings in a campaign ofÂ murder, rape and looting in Kishishe and Bambo villages. Amnesty says it interviewed survivors and witnesses whoÂ described "groups of M23 fighters going house-to-house inÂ Kishishe, summarily killing every adult male they found andÂ subjecting scores of women to rape, including gang rape." #RDCğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡©: des accablantes rÃ©vÃ©lations du nouveau rapport amnesty international "Des membres du M23 ont tuÃ© au moins vingt hommes et violÃ© des dizaines de femmes et de jeunes filles dans l'est de la RDC" rÃ©vÃ¨le l'enquÃªte d'Amnesty International publiÃ©e ce vendredi.1/3 pic.twitter.com/tIBtzZVHTw France denounces Rwanda backing of M23 rebels over DRC killings  	East African leaders demand 'immediate ceasefire' in eastern DRC Based on that evidence, Amnesty estimated that M23 killed atÂ least 20 men and raped at least 66 women and girls, mainly inÂ Kishishe, between 21 and 30 November. M23 spokesperson Willy Ngoma dismissed the report, saying "ThereÂ were no serious investigations because they did not come to theÂ field," adding that none of his soldiers wouldÂ commit rape. The militia repeatedly maintain they are protecting the local population from indiscriminate attacks and bombardments on heavily populated areas. However, Amnesty says its findings are based on research conducted on the ground in M23-occupied territory.

The conflict has sparked a diplomatic crisis between the DRC and neighbouring Rwanda, which Kinshasa accuses of backing theÂ rebels, including by sending its own troops into eastern Congo. Kigali denies any involvement. The M23 and its predecessor groups have claimed to defendÂ Tutsi interests against ethnic Hutu militias whose leadersÂ participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide of more than 800,000Â Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Amnesty has called on the Congolese authorities to followÂ through on a pledge to investigate the alleged atrocities and holdÂ the perpetrators to account. "The scale and brutality of these mass rapes is particularlyÂ shocking. M23's actions in the Kishishe area constitute warÂ crimes," the NGO said.
