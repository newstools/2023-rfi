Yoro Diao, a Senegalese tirailleur (rifleman)Â who fought in the French army in the Indochina and Algerian wars, is preparing to return to Senegal for good after the French government allowed surviving tirailleurs to claim their state pensions back home. We met him in his hostel in Bondy, near Paris, where he reflects on the past and his pride in defending his former colonial master.
