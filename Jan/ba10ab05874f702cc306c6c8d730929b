This week on The Sound Kitchen you’ll hear the answer to the question about France’s nuclear reactors. There’s the bonus question and the “Listeners Corner” with Michael Fitzpatrick, listener news, and “Music from Erwan”. All that, and the new quiz question, too, so click on the “Audio” arrow above and enjoy! Hello everyone! Welcome to The Sound Kitchen weekly podcast, published every Saturday – here on our website, or wherever you get your podcasts. You’ll hear the winner's names announced and the week’s quiz question, along with all the other ingredients you’ve grown accustomed to: your letters and essays, “On This Day”, quirky facts and news, interviews, and great music … so be sure and listen every week. The ePOP video competition is coming up! It starts soon – we’ll have precise information for you in the coming days – but don’t get left behind! Start now! The ePOP video competition is sponsored by the RFI department “Planète Radio”, whose mission is to give a voice to the voiceless. ePOP focuses on the environment, and how climate change has affected “ordinary” people …you are to create a three-minute video about climate change, the environment, pollution - told by the people it affects. So put on your thinking caps and prepare your subject, so you’re ready to go when the competition opens, which is very soon. And by the way – the prizes are incredibly generous! To read about past competitions and watch some of the videos from previous years, go to the ePOP website. It’s time to think about World Radio Day, too – it’s on 13 February as always, and this year’s theme is “Radio and Peace”. We’ll have a great big WRD celebration on The Sound Kitchen, with your greetings to your fellow radio lovers around the world. Once you have decided what you want to say, get under a blanket (it makes for better sound) and record your greeting on your phone.  Send it to us as an attachment in an e-mail to thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr  Don’t wait until the last minute!

This week’s quiz: On 3 December, I asked you a question about the environment. Earlier that week, the French government announced that a coal-fired power plant would be re-booted to get the country through the winter. There were worries that the electricity supply here would not be able to keep up with demand over the winter – due to the conflict in Ukraine, and maintenance problems with some nuclear plants. France relies on nuclear for about 70 percent of its electricity. You were to re-read our article “France reboots coal-fired power plant to boost winter electricity supplies” and answer this question: how many nuclear reactors are there in France? The answer is: 56. However, as you read in our article, around two dozen of those reactors have been offline for months, mostly due to fears over micro-cracks discovered in the emergency cooling systems. Aside from the coal plant that will be kept active until the end of March, there is only one other coal-fired power station still open in France. In addition to the quiz question, there was the bonus question: “What is the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?” The winners are: RFI English listener Khondaker Rafiqul Islam, who’s the president of the Source of Knowledge Club in Naogaon, Bangladesh. Khondaker is also the winner of this week’s bonus question. Khondaker Rafiqul Islam said the best advice he ever had was from his mother. This is what he wrote: “She was a very pious woman, and she lived very simply. I was only nine years old when she told me: ‘always speak the truth, never quarrel with others, spend your time working, reading, and writing, and build your life independently.’ “I think,” Khondaker continued, “Everybody can follow her simple advice, and prosper.” Congratulations Khondakar! Also on the list of lucky winners this week are Sakirun Islam Mitu, who’s a member of the RFI Amour Fan Club in Rajshahi, Bangladesh; Faheem Noor, the president of the RFI World United Listeners Organization in Nankana Sahib, Pakistan; RFI Listeners Club member Vladimir Gudzenko from Lukhovitsy, Russia, and RFI English listener Momotaz Parvin Naju from Bogura, Bangladesh. Congratulations winners! Here’s the music you heard on this week’s program: “The Tortoise” from Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns, performed by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andre Previn; “Autumn Leaves” by Joseph Kosma and Jacques Prévert, performed by the Bill Evans Trio; “The Flight of the Bumblebee” by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov; “The Cakewalk” from Children’s Corner by Claude Debussy, performed by the composer, and “Bluesette” by Toots Thieleman, performed by the composer and his ensemble.
