From Angola to Senegal, no fewer than 15 feature-length movies have been nominated for the top prize in next month's Fespaco pan-African film and television festival, held in Burkina Faso. Launched in 1969, the Pan-African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (Fespaco) draws thousands of movie fans and professionals from across the continent. It is also closely followed by the US and European movie industries, which scout the event for new films, talent and ideas.
