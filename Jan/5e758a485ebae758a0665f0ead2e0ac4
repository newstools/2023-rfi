France says it has extended until 15 February Covid tests for travellers arriving from China due to what has been called an "evolving situation." The requirement for travellers coming to France from China to test for Covid had initially been put in place until 31 January. However, since the start of the year, travellers aged over 11 arriving from China have had to present a negative test taken 48 hours before the flight to board the plane. According to the French authorities, random testing will be carried out and anyone testing positive will have to self-isolate, adding that everyone above six years old would have to wear face masks on the plane. Several countries had slapped fresh travel regulations on travellers from China after Beijing decided to relax strict virus restrictions.
