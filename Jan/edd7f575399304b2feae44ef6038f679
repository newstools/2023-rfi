The French foreign ministry saysÂ it hasÂ received a letter from the BurkinabeÂ authorities requesting the departure of France'sÂ ambassador from Burkina FasoÂ  â€“Â a move the ministry called "notÂ standard practice". The Burkinabe government has declined to comment officiallyÂ on reports it sent this request to Paris in December. The French ministry confirmed to RFI on Tuesday that it had received such a letter, but declined to giveÂ further details or say how it had responded. "We have indeed received a letter from the BurkinabeÂ transitional authorities. This is not standard practice and weÂ have no public comment to make in response," a spokesperson said. According to a diplomatic source, quoted by French news agency AFP, French Ambassador Luc Hallade was "still working" in Ouagadougou and the embassy's team was "accomplishing remarkable work in difficult conditions". ğŸ›‘Lâ€™ambassadeur de France au #Burkina Faso persona non grata.

According to Le Monde newspaper, it is linked to a letter of 12 December in which the ambassador requested French nationals in Koudougou â€“ 100km west of OuagadougouÂ â€“ leave the area for security reasons. He advised them to move toÂ the capital or to Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's second largest city. So far, Burkina's interim government does not appear to want to sever diplomatic relations with France. Jeune Afrique reports that the Burkina Minister of Foreign Affairs favours Hallade's replacement. The apparent expulsion nonetheless signals a further deterioration inÂ relations between France and Burkina Faso, a former FrenchÂ colony in West Africa where France maintains strong ties and has stationed special forces. Protests by opponents of the French military presence haveÂ surged there this year, partly linked to perceptions that FranceÂ has not done enough to tackle an Islamist insurgency that hasÂ spread in recent years from neighbouring Mali. The prolonged insecurity led to political instability andÂ military coups in August 2020 and May 2021 in Mali, and inÂ January 2022 and September 2022 in Burkina Faso. Angry mobs targeted the French embassy, cultural centre andÂ military base in Burkina Faso on the day of the second coup andÂ on 18 November.
